# APLTree

Homepage for all members of the APLTree library.

The APLTree library comprehends scripts (class scripts and namespace scripts) for every-day problems Dyalog APL programmers typically run into.

The APLTree library is an Open Source project; all members run under the relaxed MIT license.

For more information about the APLTree library see the [wiki](https://github.com/aplteam/apltree/wiki) in this project.

Note that prior to 2018-02 several applications supporting the Dyalog APL programmmer during the development cycle were also part of the APLTree library. Those application have been removed from the APLTree library; they are now available as members of the [apl-cation](https://github.com/aplteam/apl-cation) project.
